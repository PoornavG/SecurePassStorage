# SecurePass - Advanced Password Storage & Authentication

SecurePass is a comprehensive full-stack application designed to showcase a highly secure user authentication system. It leverages modern, robust technologies to protect user credentials, featuring Argon2id for password hashing, a unique custom salting strategy, and passwordless biometric authentication via WebAuthn.

## ✨ Key Features

* **State-of-the-Art Hashing**: Passwords are secured with **Argon2id**, the winner of the Password Hashing Competition, providing strong resistance against brute-force, dictionary, and GPU-based cracking attempts.
* **Advanced Custom Salting**: Implements a unique salting mechanism where a SHA-256 hash of the username serves as a salt, which is then interleaved with the password before hashing. This effectively nullifies rainbow table attacks.
* **Passwordless & Phishing-Resistant Login**: Integrated with **WebAuthn (FIDO2)** to allow users to register and authenticate using biometrics (like Touch ID, Face ID) or hardware security keys (like YubiKey).
* **Secure Session Management**: Uses **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** for handling user sessions, ensuring stateless and secure authentication for protected routes.
* **Interactive Security Dashboard**: The user's home page includes a dashboard that explains the security measures in place and features a live security tester to demonstrate the strength of the hashing algorithm against various simulated attacks.
* **Login Monitoring**: All login attempts (both successful and failed) are logged with IP address and timestamp, providing users with visibility into their account activity.
* **Modern Tech Stack**: Built with a modern, efficient, and scalable technology stack including React, Node.js, and MongoDB.

## 🛡️ Security Deep Dive

The core of this project is its multi-layered security architecture.

1.  **Hashing Algorithm**: We use **Argon2id** with the following secure parameters, making it computationally expensive for attackers:
    * **Memory Cost**: `65536 KB` (64 MB) to deter GPU-based parallel attacks.
    * **Time Cost**: `5` iterations to increase the time required for each hash calculation.
    * **Parallelism**: `2` threads.

2.  **Salting Process**:
    * A unique salt is deterministically generated by creating a **SHA-256 hash** of the user's username.
    * This salt is then split and strategically woven into the plain-text password *before* hashing.
    * This ensures that every password hash is unique, even for identical passwords across different user accounts.

3.  **Authentication**:
    * **JWT**: For traditional login, the server issues a short-lived JWT, which is required to access protected API endpoints.
    * **WebAuthn**: For passwordless login, a public-key credential is created and stored, allowing for highly secure, phishing-resistant authentication.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Lucide React
* **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
* **Database**: MongoDB
* **Password Hashing**: Argon2
* **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT), SimpleWebAuthn for WebAuthn/FIDO2

## 🛠️ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18.0.0 or higher)
* npm (v8 or higher)
* A running MongoDB instance (local or a free Atlas cluster)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/securepassstorage.git](https://github.com/your-username/securepassstorage.git)
    cd securepassstorage
    ```

2.  **Install all dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory. Copy the contents of `.env.example` (if available) or add the following variables:

    ```env
    # Server Port
    PORT=3000

    # MongoDB Connection String
    MONGODB_URI="your_mongodb_connection_string"
    DB_NAME="SecurePassDB"

    # JWT Secret Key (use a long, random string)
    JWT_SECRET="a_very_strong_and_secret_key_for_jwt"
    ```

### Running the Application

4.  **Start both the backend and frontend servers:**
    The project is configured to run both servers concurrently with a single command.

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    * The backend server will start on `http://localhost:3000` (or the port you specified).
    * The frontend Vite development server will start on `http://localhost:5173`.

## 📜 Available Scripts

* `npm run dev`: Starts the Vite dev server for the frontend and automatically proxies API requests to the backend.
* `npm run server`: Starts only the backend Express server.
* `npm run build`: Compiles and bundles the frontend application for production into the `dist` folder.
* `npm run lint`: Runs ESLint to check for code quality and style issues.
* `npm run test-security`: Executes a script to analyze and report on the strength and performance of the password hashing implementation.
